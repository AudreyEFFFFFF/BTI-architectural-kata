# Architecture Characteristics

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

We must choose our 7 driving architecture characteristics. Here's what we initially voted for:

1. Obervability
  - Understand what the LLM is doing (hits/misses)
  - Collect metrics from reviews and other such items
  - Compliance checks on anonymized data
2. Data Integrity:
  - Ensure job seeker profiles and employer roles are maintained correctly
  - Ensure LLM does not ignore important data when making recommendations
3. Interoperability:
  - System must autofill data from various company websites
  - LLM integration

### Lower tier
- Adaptability:
  - LLMs are an evolving technology
  - Collect data from various employer websites and job seeker resumes
- Testability
  - Provide ground truth data, tune LLM prompts, perform AB Testing
- Security
  - Working with PII (important, but not driving)
- Data Consistency:
  - Probably not as important
 - Workflow:
  - Probably not complex enough to be top 7

## Decision

Decision ("We will...") and justification (the "why").

## Consequences

Trade-offs and impact of decision.
