# 002 Architectural Style

## Status

- Proposed (WIP)

## Context

- Microservices
  - Too complex for this early stage of development
  - Cost is a problem
- Service Oriented
  - Cost is a problem
  - Seemed like too much for a business of this size
- Service Based
  - Pros: Cost, testability
  - Cons: Interoperability, integration
- Event Driven
  - Combined with Service Based
  - Helps a little with Integration and Interoperability
- Modular Monolith
  - Good on cost

## Decision
