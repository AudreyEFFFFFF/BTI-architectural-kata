# Should the LLM be used for the matching step, or just the parsing.

## Status

- Proposed
- Accepted
- Superseded

## Context

The AI needs to parse the candidate resumes into SMART goals. After that point, we have two options:
- AI is given job descriptions and matches/scores each resume against it
- AI parses job descriptions into a compatible format with resumes, then a conventional (non-AI) matching systems creates matches and scores candidates against it.

### AI Matching
Pros
- Next best thing to knowledgeable human matching

Cons
- No visibility into matching process
- Potentially expensive (depending on cost of LLM usage)

### AI Parsing, conventional matching
Pros
- More control over the matching process
- More visibility into the matching process

Cons
- We will need to be more specific about the way resumes are parsed (consistent format/wording)
- Parsed resumes might be less human-readable.
- Might miss "loose" connections that are hard for a machine to recognize (ie job calls for git experience, candidate has svn experience)


## Decision

Decision ("We will...") and justification (the "why").

## Consequences

Trade-offs and impact of decision.
