# 009 Resume Feedback Generation

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform AI must give candidates resume feedback and advice.

### Questions

- What sort of feedback and advice should our system provide?
- What data are we leveraging for this task? (Candidate resumes, with PII? Without PII? Should we include role data too?)
- How can we prompt our LLM to effectively provide feedback/advice using candidate resume data?
- Is the LLM providing general resume feedback, or feedback specific to our platform?

## Decision

We will prompt the AI to do a standard resume review and return feedback.

We will show the user the generated list of smart goals so they can adjust their resume to include missing information.

We will give feedback that is specific to our system (ie "this goal should have a measurable component").

_Decision ("We will...") and justification (the "why‚Äù)._

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
