## The Kata

### Overview

Program Name: ClearView

Program Summary: ClearView is a supplemental HR platform that anonymizes candidate information while highlighting objective skills and qualifying experience to reduce bias in the hiring process. Clear View will also be service based, enabling DEI consultants to shadow employer interviews to rate the interviewer and report findings to executive management in an effort to proactively and strategically reduce bias in the interview process.

Problem Statement #1: The lack of impactful metrics that identify and reduce potential biases in the job candidate hiring and interview process.

Problem Statement #2: The redundancy and ineffectiveness of the traditional ATS (applicant tracking software) matching viable candidates with job descriptions.
