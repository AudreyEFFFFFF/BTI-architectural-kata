# 012 Persistence Layer

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

How should we structure our system's persistence layer? How many databases, and what types?

Data that needs to be stored:
- User Data
  - Company
    - Company profile data
    - Job Descriptions (via upload
    - Candidates in process
  - Candidate
    - Resume (uploaded)
    - Profile (mostly? from resume)
    - Demographic data (user provided)
    - Contact info
    - Companies/roles in process
- Analytic Data (for administrators)
  - User/demographics per role at each point in process
    - Selected after initial match
    - First interview
    - Given offer vs rejected
  - Account status for users
  - Status for roles
- Metric Data (for platform developers)

## Decision

_Decision ("We will...") and justification (the "why")._

## Consequences
