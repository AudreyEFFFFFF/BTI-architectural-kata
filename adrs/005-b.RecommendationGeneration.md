# 005-b Recommendation Generation

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform must provide a match score between roles and candidates.

### Questions

- Assumption: we have decided whether or not we will use the LLM for matching.
- How can we leverage existing search capabilities (e.g. Elasticsearch, Opensearch, Kendra) to generate "recommendations" (match scores)?
- How does this impact our desired data model?

## Decision

_Decision ("We will...") and justification (the "why‚Äù)._

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
