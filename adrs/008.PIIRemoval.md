# 007 PII Removal

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform AI must remove any personal, racial, cultural, and lifestyle indicators (PII). 

### Questions

- Should this happen before or after SMART goal format parsing.
- How can we train and/or prompt our LLM to remove PII, while maintaining non-PII Data Integrity? Are we able to train our LLM beyond it's pre-training?
- Alternatively: Can we assume the LLM is already trained to do this well (as suggested by the requirements) with a straightforward prompt?
- Assumption: We have decided on a strategy for parsing candidate resumes into SMART goal format (Ref: [006.ResumeParsing.md](./adrs/006.ResumeParsing.md))

## Decision
