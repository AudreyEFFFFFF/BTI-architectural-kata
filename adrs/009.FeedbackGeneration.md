# 009 Resume Feedback Generation

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform AI must give candidates resume feedback and advice.

### Questions

- What sort of feedback and advice should our system provide?
- What data are we leveraging for this task? (Candidate resumes, with PII? Without PII? Should we include role data too?)
- How can we prompt our LLM to effectively provide feedback/advice using candidate resume data?

## Decision

_Decision ("We will...") and justification (the "why‚Äù)._

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
