# 010 Data Observability

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform must collect data on hiring processes.

The following data needs to be collected:
- Candidates (demographic info) accepted after initial match, by role and company
- Candidates (demographic info) who attend first interview, by role and company
- Candidates (demographic info) who are offered/rejected for the role at the final stage, by role and company
- 5 Question survey to candidate about interviewer (after 1st interview)
- 5 Question survey to interviewer about candidate (after 1st interview)

This will be aggregated/analyzed by platform administrators. The date store should be good for analytic queries.


### Questions

- What additional data about the hiring process should we be collecting?
- How should we collect this data (e.g. event-driven)?
- How should we store this data?

## Decision

_Decision ("We will...") and justification (the "why‚Äù)._

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
