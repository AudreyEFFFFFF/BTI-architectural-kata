# 002 Architectural Style

## Status

- Accepted

## Context

### Discussion

- Microservices
  - Too complex for this early stage of development
  - Cost is a problem
- Service Oriented
  - Cost is a problem
  - Seemed like too much for a business of this size
- Service Based
  - Pros: Cost, testability
  - Cons: Interoperability, integration
- Event Driven
  - Combined with Service Based
  - Helps a little with Integration and Interoperability
- Modular Monolith
  - Good on cost

## Decision

We will use an Event-Driven Service-Based architecture style.

## Consequences

### Pros

- Pretty good on Cost and Simplicity. We don't want to jump straight into something like Microservices just because it has the most stars on the chart; the added complexity is unnecessary and undesireable at this stage in development.
- Our development team already has experience working with systems that utilize this architecture style.
- Good for Deployability, Fault Tolerance, Performance, and Scalability; while these were not our driving characteristics, they are still important for any user-facing application.

### Cons

- Not the best Integration and Interoperability, which may impact our ability to work with distinct HR APIs.

### Impact

We can frame our upcoming architecture discussions with this style in mind.
