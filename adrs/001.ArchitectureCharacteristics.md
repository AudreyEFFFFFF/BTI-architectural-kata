## Status

- Accepted

## Context

### Discussion

Top dicussed:

- Adaptability:
  - LLMs are an evolving technology
  - Collect data from various employer websites and job seeker resumes
- Cost
  - Non-profits may have limited budget
- Data Integrity:
  - Ensure job seeker profiles and employer roles are maintained correctly
  - Ensure LLM does not ignore important data when making recommendations
- Interoperability:
  - System must autofill data from various company websites
  - LLM integration
- Obervability
  - Understand what the LLM is doing (hits/misses)
  - Collect metrics from reviews and other such items
  - Compliance checks on anonymized data
- Security
  - Working with PII (important, but not driving)
- Testability
  - Provide ground truth data, tune LLM prompts, perform AB Testing

Others discussed:

- Concurrency
- Configurability
- Data Consistency
- Feasibility
- Workflow

## Decision

We will choose the following as our driving architecture characteristics:

1. Observability
2. Data Integrity
3. Interoperability
4. Adaptability
5. Testability
6. Security

## Consequences

### Impact

We can utilize these architecture characteristics when determining which architecture style is best for our system.
