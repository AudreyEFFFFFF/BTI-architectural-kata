# 003 HR Interoperability

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform must interface with popular HR software in order to collect information about companies and their open roles.

### Questions

- What will we require these companies to provide (e.g. APIs)?
- How can we design our architecture to be extensible and work with distinct HR software?
- How will this design integrate with our LLM?

## Decision

_We will use cloud computing because we are a small company without the resources to manage servers.

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
