# 006 Resume Parsing

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform must parse candidate resumes into S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound) goal format to quantifiably match their skills and experience to job descriptions.

### Questions

- Assumption: We will be provided candidate resumes via a candidate's interaction with our UI.
- Assumption: Resume information has been parsed to a standard text format.
- Assumption personal and potential racial, gendered, cultural, and lifestyle information has been removed.
- How can we prompt our LLM to effectively parse a candidate's resume into SMART goal format, while maintaining Data Integrity?
- How should candidate data be stored?

## Decision

Prompt LLM to parse resume into SMART goals.

We will have the LLM return both complete and incomplete (more information required) SMART goals. We will show SMART goals to candidate user so they can regenerate with an updated or completed resume. User will not be able to change smart goals directly.

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
