# 006 Resume Parsing

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform must parse candidate resumes into S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound) goal format to quantifiably match their skills and experience to job descriptions.

### Questions

- Assumption: We will be provided candidate resumes via a candidate's interaction with our UI.
- How can we prompt our LLM to effectively parse a candidate's resume into SMART goal format, while maintaining Data Integrity?
- How should candidate data be stored?

## Decision

_Decision ("We will...") and justification (the "why‚Äù)._

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
