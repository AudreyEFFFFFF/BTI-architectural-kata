# 007 PII Removal

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform AI must remove any personal, racial, cultural, and lifestyle indicators (PII). 

### Questions

- Assumption: We have decided on a strategy for parsing candidate resumes into SMART goal format (Ref: [006.ResumeParsing.md](./adrs/006.ResumeParsing.md))
- Should this happen before or after SMART goal format parsing.
- How can we train and/or prompt our LLM to remove PII, while maintaining non-PII Data Integrity?

## Decision
