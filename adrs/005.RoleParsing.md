# 005 Role Parsing

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform must parse a company's open roles in order to match candidates with roles.

### Questions

- Assumption: We will be provided role data via our integration with HR software (Ref: [003.HRInteroperability.md](./adrs/003.HRInteroperability.md)) and/or manual upload or insertion from a company's Hiring Manager.
- How can we prompt our LLM to effectively parse provided role data, while maintaining Data Integrity?
- How should role data be stored?

## Decision

Upon uploading a role description, we will prompt the AI to parse the role into into SMART goals.

We will have the LLM return list of SMART goals. We will show SMART goals to company user so they can regenerate with an updated role. Company user will be able to make requests to platform administrator to manually change smart goals.

We will store both the raw role description and the parsed description.

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
