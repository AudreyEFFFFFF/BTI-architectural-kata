# 004 Company Data Collection

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform AI must automatically collect publicly-available company information and use it to fill out a company profile.

### Questions

- Can we utilize our existing integration with HR software to collect this data? (Ref: [003.HRInteroperability.md](./adrs/003.HRInteroperability.md))
- Will we need to collect this data from other sources (e.g. autonomously scraping public webpages)?
- How can we leverage our LLM to collect and parse this data?

## Decision

_Decision ("We will...") and justification (the "why‚Äù)._

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
