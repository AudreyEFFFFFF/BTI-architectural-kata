# 012 Database Layer

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

How should we structure our system's database layer? How many databases, and what types?

Data that needs to be stored:
- User Data
  - Company
    - Company profile data
    - Job Descriptions (via upload)
    - Candidates in process
  - Candidate
    - Resume (uploaded)
    - Profile (mostly? from resume)
    - Demographic data (user provided)
    - Contact info
    - Companies/roles in process
- Analytic Data (for administrators)
  - User/demographics per role at each point in process
    - Selected after initial match
    - First interview
    - Given offer vs rejected
  - Account status for users
  - Status for roles
- Metric Data (for platform developers)

Questions:
- Should we store candidate resumes in:
  - raw form
  - parsed form
  - some intermediate form
  - multiple of these
- Should we store role descriptions in:
  - raw form
  - parsed form
  - some intermediate form
  - multiple of these
- Should we pre-aggregate any data?

## Decision

We will have four datastores.

A structured, SQL database (such as postgres) for user data and analytic data.

A NOSQL, unstructured document database for parsed resumes and roles

A vector-based database (such as elasticsearch) for storing parsed resumes to match against.

File store for uploaded documents (stored as uploaded).

We are storing parsed resumes twice because the vector database will not store them in a human-readable format.

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
