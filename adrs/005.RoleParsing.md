# 005 Role Parsing

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Per our [system requirements](../main/problem/Requirements.md), our platform must parse a company's open roles in order to match candidates with roles.

### Questions

- Assumption: We will be provided role data via our integration with HR software (Ref: [003.HRInteroperability.md](./adrs/003.HRInteroperability.md)) and/or manual insertion from a company's Hiring Manager.
- How can we prompt our LLM to effectively parse provided role data, while maintaining Data Integrity?
- How should role data be stored?

## Decision

_Decision ("We will...") and justification (the "why‚Äù)._

## Consequences

_Trade-offs and impact of decision._
