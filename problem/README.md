## Background

ClearView is a supplemental HR platform created by the Diversity Cyber Council, a 501c3 non-profit serving underrepresented demographics in the technology industry. ClearView intends to provide a better hiring practice by effectively matching objective skills and qualifying experiences with job descriptions, while obscuring personal and demographic data. This will allow employers to find better candidates by finding the best need-based matches while decreasing the impact of bias. The platform will also allow consultants to observe interviews and gather data to proactively and strategically reduce bias throughout the process.

The platform also aims to provide a better experience for both job seekers and employers. It aims to leverage AI not just for job matching, but also for reducing redundant data entry tasks and providing feedback to candidates on their resumes.
